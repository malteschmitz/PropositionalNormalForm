# Generate Normal Forms for Expressions in Propositional Logic

Exemplary Java implementation of a _recursive decent parser_, an _abstract syntax tree (AST) data structure_ and _structural recursive AST transformations_ over this data structure.

## Building

The maven project can be build with

```
mvn compile
```

which compiles the Java code.

Without maven you can compile the Java code manually as follows:

```
mkdir -p target/classes
javac -d target/classes src/main/java/*.java src/main/java/**/*.java
```

## Running

You can run ... with

```
java -cp target/classes Main mult.whl
```

The expected output is

```
...
```
